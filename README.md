# Ham CW Testing

I wrote this so I can try and practice for the Philippines NTC CW Exam. This is very embarassing - as I passed my UK test over 15 years ago, and I regularly send CW, and I participate in Contests etc.

The NTC Test is 5 WPM !! ... Which is very very bad for longer term morse operations.

You are only required to do the morse test plus Elements 8,9 and 10 for a Class 'A' licence.
But as this gives you some extra bands - this is something I believe everyone should strive for.

## NTC Exam

Feb 2020.

After your theory exam, they will prepare a smaller room, where you will bring your CW test sheet - the one with your number on it.

Get comfortable, and relax.


## CW Report Page

On the test sheet. I suggest you dwaw something line this on the paper

```
----- ----- ----- ----- -----    --
----- ----- ----- ----- -----    --
----- ----- ----- ----- -----    --
----- ----- ----- ----- -----    --
----- ----- ----- ----- -----    --
----- ----- ----- ----- -----    --
```

You can then fill this in.... as I will explain below.

## Pre Sending  - hearing check

The proctor will then ask you if you can hear this - and they will then start the computer program.

I think it starts "HR AA    HR AA    HR    AA" 

**You do not have to copy this bit....** 

You will now hear 5 groups of 5 repeated 5 times .... At the end of each line there is a AA. Look above at my suggested way of filling in the sheet... 

This is what the test data will look like (obviously different words will be used).


```text

HELLO THISI SATES TEXAM SENTA   AA
TFIVE WORDS AMINU TETOS EEIFY   AA
OUCAN ZEBRA XYLIN THISE XAMJO   AA
HNWAS QUEEN FORTO DAYUN TILAM   AA
ISTAK EFORC EDHIM TOFAI LTHIS   AA

```

So some points to note

  - They are sending English words (sorry no Tagalog/Visaya etc)
  - The test is sent a 5 WPM (very slow - this I think makes it more difficult)
  - Each Line end with AA
    - You do not need to write it - but it helps you keep track of where you are.
  
## Tips

  - Keep calm, and relax
  - If you miss a letter - leave a gap.... you may be able to guess the letter later.
  - try and enjoy morse code

## Time this takes

The exam - will take aprox 400 seconds (6 mins and 30 seconds). I think you will be surprised however just how fast this time goes.

# Programming Notes
I have tried VERY VERY hard to ensure that the timing of this code generator is accurate. 
I currently believe that it is.

## Installing 

I suggest that you clone the repo which can be found at https://github.com/timseed/NTCCW.git
